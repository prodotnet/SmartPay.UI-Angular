## Overview

The **Voice-Activated Safe Mode (VASM)** is a security-first feature in **SmartPay** ‚Äî a digital wallet designed to protect users in high-risk scenarios such as armed robberies or coercion. It uses AI-driven voice recognition or a panic phrase to trigger a hidden mode, protecting the user‚Äôs real funds and preventing transaction access under duress.

---

## Problem Statement

In high-crime environments, users may be forced to open their mobile wallets under threat. If a criminal sees a large balance or is able to transfer funds, the user‚Äôs safety is compromised. There is currently no mainstream digital wallet that allows users to instantly disguise or lock their accounts under pressure.

---

## Proposed Solution

SmartPay introduces a **Voice-Activated Safe Mode**, allowing the user to:

- Speak a predefined panic phrase or use voice tone detection.
- Instantly switch the app interface to show a fake balance (e.g., `R0.00`).
- Disable all fund transfers or withdrawals.
- Optionally send a silent alert to trusted contacts or admin.
- Resume normal access only after secure re-authentication.

## Feature Flow

### üîê Normal Login Flow:
1. User logs in with regular PIN or biometric.
2. App fetches real wallet data and displays it.

### üö® Safe Mode Triggered Flow:
1. User speaks a panic phrase (e.g., ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt hurt me‚Äù).
2. App detects the phrase via voice recognition module.
3. App activates **Safe Mode**:
    - Shows dummy balance.
    - Transaction options are hidden or disabled.
    - Triggers optional silent alert.
4. To exit Safe Mode, user must log out and log in again with a **secondary secure PIN**.
